# Railway-tickketing-system
This project helps in replicating the railway ticketing system that allows users to find all the trains from source to destination by taking in the data of trains stored in the local database.
I have used Tkinter for the GUI and Microsodt SQL as the local database to store deatils of the stations and trains.
